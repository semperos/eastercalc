# Calculating Pascha and Easter

This is a web app (written with [Noir](https://github.com/ibdknox/noir) that provides two views:

 1. Calculate the date of easter for the years of a given time span
 2. Calculate all the years for each date of easter for a given time span

Thus it provides the answer to the standard "What date is Easter this year?" as well as "In the next 100 years, in what years will Easter occur on April 10th?"

## Usage

To run the site, pull down dependencies and run the app:

```bash
lein deps
lein run
```

Use `lein run --help` to see all command-line options.
